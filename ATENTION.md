# Hi!
I only expressed my frustration with the school, by "breaking" the data and making this github deploy. I felt annoyed and disappointed, because at that time the CBI School had gone viral, which is where there are some students comparing Private schools and Public schools. Until finally the student made a Clarification video, and it was watched by more than 10 million views. I felt ashamed, and even thought I regretted going to school at CBI, because of the viral video. Thanks.
# Addition
I will be deleting these repositories on August 17, 2022. Sorry and Thanks.
